Some notes for each package:

- autocorrect: files from Autocorrect. 
	- Main is how to start the gui or the reply suggestions
	- Contains all the general Trie class
	- Autocorrect contains the bulk of the code. It contains all the calculation and holds all the values when actually running the program
	- Led is a more involved comparator to compare the rankings. I removed it outside for clarity. There is a nested compartor in autocorrect.
- gui is in your typical resource files. 
	- Most of the heavy lifting is done in main.js
	- The gui uses autocomplete jquery to display (the format not the suggestions those are my own)
